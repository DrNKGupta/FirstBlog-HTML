      HTML is short of hypertext markup language. Basically, it's the "code"
      behind every webpage- even this one. If you're just begining to learn
      HTML, let us tell you that it's fairly easy task. HTML without styling
      can't do anything more than setting a layout, drawing a table, or creating
      frames - but it is handy as it helps you structure the content correctly,
      which is important when you sit down to add style to your HTML.

      However simple this might seem, it is a mighty usefulTool when it comes to
      full-fledged web development. Various tools easily eliminate the HTML
      coding from your work process- but if you want to be in full control of
      your web page, you'll need to have some command over HTML.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through this article,We aim to give you the essential HTML Building blocks
      that will help you get up and running. Reading this, you will be able to
      understand an HTML source code and even modify it for your own good!
    </p>
    <h3>Step One - TAGS</h3>
    <img src="https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001485.png" />
  <p>
    Tags are what you will see the most when you look at HTML source code.
    A tag can ideally be seen as a wrapper To any item on your HTML document.
    Tags tell what magic is to be done on the content enclosed by them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's look at two types of tags:
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
         &lttag-example-1&gt I need a closign tag &lttag-example&gt
         </li>
         <li>&l ttag-example-2 &gt I don't need a cloding tag.</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    In the first example, the sentence is wrapped by two tags.The first one, is called the opening tag. And the second one is called the closing tag.
    Everything in between is affected by the properties of the tag.Very commonly used example of such tags are &lt html &gt, &lt head &gt,
    &lt body &gt, &lt strong &gt, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    The second example tags about loner tags- as in, they don't need a closing tag to function. Although it's not requiredThese types of tags are often written as
    &lt tag/ &gt to make the debugging of code easier.Common examples of such tags are
    &lt hr/&gt - used for horizontal line, &lt br/ &gt- to break the line etc.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Step Two- HTML, HEAD, and BODY: The three pillars of your document
  </h3>
  <img src="https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001488.jpg">
<p>
  These tags are essential for any HTML document.They parcel out the significant parts of your HTML code.
  <ul>
    <li>
      &lt BODY &gt &lt /BODY&gt is placed below your &ltHEAD&gt tag, And everything that you want to be displayed on your screen comes under this tag.
      Text, images, links and pretty much anything you can see in 
      your browser live inside this tag.
    </li>
    <li>
      &ltHTML&gt &lt/HTML&gt wraps your entire code.Everything else in your HTML document need to come inside this tag.
    </li>
    <li>
      &ltHEAD&gt &lt/HEAD&gt includes things like title, styles and scripts. Head is usually present at the top (hah!),
      just inside the &ltHTML&gt tag.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h3>Steps three - A few tags that'll make your page pretty</h3>
<p>
  Now that you know how to set up the skeleton of your document,lets proceed with the things that will go inside your &tBODY&gt tag and do some magic!
</p>
<p>Some Basic text formatting tags:
  <ul>
    <li>&ltb&gt &lt/b&gt makes your text look <b>bold</b></li>
    <li>&lti&gt &lt/i&gt makes your write in <i>cursive</i></li>
    <li>&ltu&gt &lt/u&gt <u>underline</u> what you just wrote</li>
  </ul>

</p>
<p>
  For example, this piece of code
</p>
<hr>
<p>&lthtml&gt
<p>&lt head &gt &lt /head &gt</p>
<p>&lt body &gt</p>
&lti&gt I am italics! &lt/i&gt &ltbr/&gt <br>
&ltb&gt I am bold! &ltb&gt &ltbr&gt <br>
&ltu&gt And me, well, I'm underlined! &lt/u&gt &ltbr/&gt
<p>&ltbody&gt</p>
</p>
<p>&lthtml&gt</p>
<hr><br>
<p>
  Should produce something like this on your browser: Don't fret too much about the
  &ltbr/&gt. It's just for breaking the line so that you can start from the next line. Enter key does little when
  it comes to changing lines in your HTML document.

<h3> Tags to help you structure your content: </h3>
<ul>
  <li> &ltbr/&gt break the line, making your continue to the next line </li>
  <li>&ltp&gt stands for paragraph. It divides your content into paragraphs</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <i>Note: You need to use these tags as space and enter keys do very little when it comes to formatting content inside
    an HTML document.</i>
</p>
<h3>Heading Tags:</h3>
<p>
  HTML provides you six tags, from &ltH1&gt &lt/H1&gt to &ltH6&gt <&lt/H6&gt to help you create different sized
  headers quickly.
</p>

<h3>Inserting an Image:</h3>
<p>
  All that is good, but what fun without images on the web page?Don't worry, &ltIMG/&gt to the rescue!
  The image tag has a mandatory attribute called "source".Basically, it tells the browser where it should look for the image.
  The syntax goes something like: <br>
  &lt <i>img src="path_to_you_image"/</i>&gt
</p>
<p>
  Furthermore, it also has attributes like height and widths that let you specify the height and width you want in your image.
</p>
<h3>Lists:</h3>
<p>
  HTML has two types of list, ordered and unauthored.Each item in your list has to be enclosed in a tag.
  The syntax for creating a list is fairly simple.
</p>
<p>
  Suppose you want to create a list like:
  <ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Itetm 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>The following code will eaily do the job for you:</p>
<hr>
<p>
  &ltul&gt <br>
  &nbsp &ltli&gt Item 1 &lt/li&gt <br>
  &nbsp &lt li &gt Item 2 &lt /li &gt <br>
  &nbsp &lt li &gt Item 3 &lt /li &gt <br>
  &lt/ul &gt
</p>
<hr>
<p>
  This, by the way, was An example of an unordered list.For an ordered list, all you need to do is replace
  &lt ul &gt with &lt ol&gt and &lt /ul&gt with &lt/ol&gt.
</p>
<p>
  Let's see what the following code does:
</p>
<hr>
  <i>
<p>&lt html &gt</p>
<p>&nbsp &lt head &gt &nbsp &lt /head &gt</p>
<p>&nbsp &lt body &gt</p>
<p>
  &nbsp &nbsp &lt ul &gt <br>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &lt li &gt I am unordered list's item 1! &lt /li &gt <br>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &lt li &gt I am unordered list's item 2! &lt /li &gt <br>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &lt li &gt I am unordered list's item 3! &lt /li &gt <br>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &lt li &gt I am unordered list's item 4! &lt /li &gt <br> 
  &nbsp &nbsp &lt /ul &gt <br>
  &nbsp &nbsp &lt ol &gt <br>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &lt li &gt I am ordered list's item 1! &lt /li &gt <br>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &lt li &gt I am ordered list's item 2! &lt /li &gt <br>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &lt li &gt I am ordered list's item 3! &lt /li &gt <br>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &lt li &gt I am ordered list's item 4! &lt /li &gt <br>
  &nbsp &nbsp &lt /ol &gt

</p>
<p>&nbsp &lt /body &gt</p>
<p> &lt /html &gt </p> </i>
<hr><hr>
<img src="https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001489.png">
<p>
  All of these tags, when arranged coherently will provide you with simple
  Web page consisting of images, headings and lists. Further, there are various tags that HTML support and V thoroughly
  recommend you to check them out and play with them!
</p>
<h2>In Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  You now know enough to skimTrue and understand any part of any HTML code.We request you to go ahead and try skimming through the source code of any website
  (You will find some tags you don't know,But that's how you learn!). Oh, And welcome to the world of web development.
  With HTML under your belt, your next stop should be making your page look beautiful using CSS.
